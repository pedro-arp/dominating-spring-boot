Exercise 12 - User Service - Dominating Spring Boot

Create another microservice called user-service, this microservice should have an
endpoint called v1/users with all the CRUD operations.
The User domain should have the following attributes: id, firstName, lastName, email.
Follow the best practices you've learned so far, patterns, tests, high cohesion etc.
